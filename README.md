# CNN-neural-network
In this project, we will use the Fashion-MNIST dataset using a CNN neural network architecture
In this exercise we need to implement a LeNet-5 network to recognize the Fashion-
MNIST digits.
 Modify hyperparameters to get to the best performance you can achieve.
 Evaluate the model using 5-fold cross-validation.
 In the report, provide a plot of accuracy improvement using the previously
mentioned techniques. Also plot the convergence curve for LeNet-5.
 Comment on why you think LeNet-5 further improves the accuracy if any at all.
And if it doesn't, why not?
 Note that this is an open-ended problem. So, there could be very good solutions.
 Try to use other two CNN models (using transfer learning) and compare the
results with the full trained LeNet-5.
